`North American GeoGebra Journal Template` 
`Jupyter Lab Code Cells Template`

## Sources
First, this template is a clone of the 
[North American GeoGebra Journal Template](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/nagj). 
Also, Jupyter Lab's $\LaTeX$ preambles for
code cells were combined together.
What this means is that this template has
the best of both worlds. 

All code cells on this template look exactly like `Jupyter Lab`'s
code cells. Every other part of the document
are exactly the same as `North American GeoGebra Journal`'s template.

After you download this repository, you can use it just as a normal `.tex` file. 
Personally, I edit all my <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LaTeX">
documents by
1. downloading [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/),
2. installing Jupyter Lab, which comes with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), and
3. using [Jupyter Lab LaTeX Extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-latex).

However, you could use `vim`, `TeXstudio`, `Jupyter Lab`, or any other
editing software to edit this.
