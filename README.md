`North American GeoGebra Journal Template` 
`Jupyter Lab Code Output Cells Template`

## Sources
First, this template was cloned from [https://github.com/jamesquinlan/nagj](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/nagj). 
Also, Jupyter Lab's $\LaTeX$ preambles for
code cells were cloned into `coding.tex`.
What this means is that this template has
the best of both worlds. 

All code cells on this template look exactly like `Jupyter Lab`'s
code cells. Every other part of the document
are exactly the same as `North American GeoGebra Journal`'s template.
